# Drumuri-Agitate

The second game I made in Unity – a modern take on the classic Frogger gameplay!

Drumuri Agitate is a 2D arcade game where you navigate a character across busy roads and rivers, avoiding obstacles and reaching the goal. With pixel-perfect movement and increasing difficulty, it's a fun yet challenging experience.

Features:

- Classic Frogger-Inspired Gameplay – Dodge traffic, hop across logs, and make it to safety.

- Multiple Lanes of Traffic & Obstacles – Cars, trucks, and floating hazards keep every move intense.

- Simple & Responsive Controls – Move in four directions with smooth, intuitive input.

- Score & Progress Tracking – See how far you can go and challenge yourself to beat your high score.

- Start Menu & Game Over Screen – Easily restart the game after each attempt.

- Gradual Difficulty Increase – Faster vehicles and trickier obstacles as you progress!

Tech Highlights:

- Custom scripts for character movement, obstacle spawning, and collision detection.

- Unity’s Canvas system for UI elements like menus and score displays.

- Animated sprites and environmental details for an engaging 2D world.

- Efficient object pooling for smooth performance.

A great project for improving Unity 2D skills and game logic while recreating a nostalgic classic!
